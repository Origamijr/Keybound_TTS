q	"Hello. Welcome to my project, ""Masked Reality"". I thought it would be a good idea to add commentary, but I don't like listening to the sound of my own voice. As such, I will be using text to speech to explain what's going on."
w	"As you can see, I have some masks floating by this pedastal. At first they seem pretty normal, but something interesting happens when you look through the masks."
e	Amazing! I'm underwater!
r	"And now I'm not. This effect is created by a stencil shader, which assigns numbers to each object . Looking through the masks filters out what numbered objects are being displayed. So in reality everything exists in this one scene, but they are invisible until you put on the right mask. Let's see where the other masks bring us."
t	I built in a small puzzle in order to increase playtime. I will be walking through that puzzle in this video. Spoiler warning. We'll start by putting on the scuba mask again.
y	No cheating allowed. I'll need a key to see what's inside. I think I remember seeing one with the gas mask on.
u	"""It's dangerous to go alone. Take this"". I should try taking this key with me"
i	Interesting. The key followed me to the hub world. I wonder if I could use it on the key in the underwater world.
o	Nice
p	"Grab the YELLOW cloud and put it in the bowl. I remember a bowl in the curtain room, but where is the yellow cloud? Probably has to do with the sky world. Let's check it out."
a	I don't see any yellow cloud. Let's try moving this hot air balloon around to see if I could find it.
s	Ah. There it is
d	Cool. Let's put this in the bowl and see what happens
f	What happened? I don't see anything that changed.
g	Ah. I win. Cool. Totally didn't know that was going to happen. 
h	Well thanks for watching and I hoped you enjoyed my virtual environment.
z	Oops wrong audio clip.
x	Ok.
c	Nice
v	Let me check the video length.
b	Apologies for the glitchiness.
n	This video will be split along both eyes since it looks weird with one eye. I wonder if this will work with a Google cardboard. Probably not.
